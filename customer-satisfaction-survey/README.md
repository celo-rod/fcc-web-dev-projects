# Consumer Satisfaction Survey Form

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Web Development course. It demonstrates my ability to create a structured and user-friendly form using HTML and CSS.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: Main HTML file.
- `css/styles.css`: Main CSS file for styling the HTML.
- `assets/`: A directory containing images, icons, and other media files used in the project.
